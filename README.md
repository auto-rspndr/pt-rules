Don't copy my skins, yada yada.


If you want to know how I did a certain thing, please feel free to ask!


All I ask is you be respectful of others, and if you dislike someone then be an adult and block them. Deliberately pissing people off is incredibly immature. It's just a game.


I don't like arguing nor drama and will either mute or block ppl who engage in both >thumbs up<


I'm always on DND mostly just because I forget to turn it off. I'm usually at my screen though.
